 ************************** How to install DotNetCore in Brief

-Do the installation exactly how it is set here on a brand new Linux 14.04: https://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/

-see the dotnet-nightly packages and version numbers (you want the biggest version number, that is the latest)
http://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet/pool/main/d/dotnet-nightly/

-see currently installed version number
dpkg -s dotnet-nightly		// The apt-get utilities are simply a front-end to the debian dpkg utility

- see the latest daily DotNetCore NuGet packages:
https://dotnet.myget.org/gallery/dotnet-core


*************************** Server topology
When the Linux based VBroker is ready, we will have 2 Linux servers:

1. Free 1GB Linux, Developer machine, so GUI is needed (Xubuntu again).
-Overmind.exe is there
-the real-time price service CAN be there (not necessarily) with a paper account of drCharmat/wife (gives real-time REAL prices. Demo account gives mockup price data, not real)
That realtime price data should be separated anyway from the TradingServer VirtualBroker, and that could go to a free Linux Nano instance.
the real-time price service should use a paper account of somebody (probably Wife), that gives real-time data.
-HealthMonitor.exe should not be there (in the long term. Temporarily, it is ok.)
-can be used for Dev, not production

2. A 2GB Linux, VBrokerAgent Server, Runs 2 or 3 IB Gateways + VBrokers.
>There can me many users: Charmat, Agy, Balazs, Laci, T, so many IBGateways are required
>2 IBGateways require: 2*320GB=640GB just itself. I tried to run 2 IBGateways on the 1GB Linux
and it virtually frozen. After 10 minutes inactivity (Out-of-memory exceptions I guess), one IBGateway crashed. Luckyliy.
Ony after the first IBGateway crashed, was there enough memory than the system revived. (if it doesn't crash, I cannot even soft-reboot the VM)
When the 2 IBGateway runs: at start the system consumes: 940MB of 991MB memory. (Overmind 100MB is not run in this case.)
