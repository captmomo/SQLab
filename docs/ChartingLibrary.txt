"We've found out that you've published the Charting Library copy in your public repository here: 
https://github.com/gyantal/NeuralSniffer
We have the Charting Library in our private repo and we don't want it to be publicly available like this. 
Please remove this copy asap and let me know when it is removed.
The common way to do what you wanted is to (1) fork our Charting Library repo and then (2) 
remove your charting_library folder and replace it with the git submodule referring to your own Charting Library fork.""
